1.	Start with the most specific hypothesis. 
h = {ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ, ϕ}
2.	Take the next example and if it is negative, then no changes occur to the hypothesis.
3.	If the example is positive and we find that our initial hypothesis is too specific then we update our current hypothesis to a general condition.
4.	Keep repeating the above steps till all the training examples are complete.
5.	After we have completed all the training examples, we will have the final hypothesis when can use to classify the new examples.

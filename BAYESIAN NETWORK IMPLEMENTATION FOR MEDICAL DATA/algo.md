ALGORITHM:
1. First, identify which are the main variable in the problem to solve. Each variable
corresponds to a node of the network. It is important to choose the number states for each
variable, for instance, there are usually two states (true or false).
2. Second, define structure of the network, that is, the causal relationships between all the
variables (nodes).
3. Third, define the probability rules governing the relationships between the variables.

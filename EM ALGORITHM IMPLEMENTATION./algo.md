ALGORITHM:
1. Given a set of incomplete data, consider a set of starting parameters.
2. Expectation step (E – step): Using the observed available data of the dataset, estimate
(guess) the values of the missing data.
3. Maximization step (M – step): Complete data generated after the expectation (E) step is
used in order to update the parameters.
4. Repeat step 2 and step 3 until convergence
